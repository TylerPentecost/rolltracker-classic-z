RollTracker Classic

Have you ever tried to roll the 'Onyxia Hide Backpack' in a raid? RTC collects all roll results and sorts them. Ever thought about whether you wanted something for your second-equip, but didn't know if somebody needed it? RTC can automatically open the Blizzard 'Loot rolls' window, where you can see immediately who needs or has greed.
In raid ever lost the overview, who got what? Again, RTC can help you. On request, it records all items, including a variable export function.

Usage
RTC will automatically open when someone rolls the dice. Double rolls or rolls outside the default range are ignored on request.
By default, the automatic opening of 'Loot Rolls' is disabled. Likewise, the 'Loot Tracker' must be turned on manually.
